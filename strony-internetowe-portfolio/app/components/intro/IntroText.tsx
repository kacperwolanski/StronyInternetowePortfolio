        I&apos;m a full stack developer (React.js & Node.js) with a focus on
        creating (and occasionally designing) exceptional digital experiences
        that are fast, accessible, visually appealing, and responsive. Even
        though I have been creating web applications for over 7 years, I still
        love it as if it was something new
